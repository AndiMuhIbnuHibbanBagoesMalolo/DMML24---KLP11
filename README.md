Project Data Mining
Data on estimated body fat can be used to estimate the percentage of fat, allowing for the determination of actual body weight without its fat content, as well as BMI prediction.

-Objective
The objective of the analysis is to understand the relationship between body circumference measurements and body weight with body fat percentage, and to develop a predictive model to estimate body fat percentage.

-The variables listed below, from left to right, are:

Density determined from underwater weighing
Percent body fat from Siri's (1956) equation
Age (years)
Weight (lbs)
Height (inches)
Neck circumference (cm)
Chest circumference (cm)
Abdomen 2 circumference (cm)
Hip circumference (cm)
Thigh circumference (cm)
Knee circumference (cm)
Ankle circumference (cm)
Biceps (extended) circumference (cm)
Forearm circumference (cm)
Wrist circumference (cm)
